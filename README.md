# React CRUD Project: User Management

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React. It allows users to manage a list of users, performing operations like adding new users, updating existing ones, and deleting them. The project utilizes React Router for navigation, Context API for state management, and a mock API for backend operations.
